## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Terrorist attacks have massive economic and psycological effect on wide range of population. In the sense that the dynamics such as trends over years in target groups, weapon types, dangerous groups, numbers of terrorist attacks are analysed, that could enable policy makers, gorvernments, analysts to prevent them in future. [The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/access/) is the source for our data defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. 

In our study, We do consider attacks that were attempted whether they are succesful or not and classified as not doubted. This approach allow us to evaluate data from broader perspective comprehensively.

### Domain Characterization <a name="domain-characterization"></a>

The GTD is an event-level database containing more than 200,000 records of terrorist attacks that took place around the world beteween years 1970 and 2019. For each event, a wide range of information is available, including the date and location of the incident, the weapons used, nature of the target, the number of casualties, and – when identifiable – the group or individual responsible. It is maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland. 

We have used this dataset to visualise the development of terrorist attacks on global over years.

Example for tables:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
