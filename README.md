## Introduction

Terrorist attacks have massive economic and psycological effect on wide range of population. In the sense that the dynamics such as trends over years in target groups, weapon types, dangerous groups, numbers of terrorist attacks are analysed, that could enable policy makers, gorvernments, analysts to prevent them in future. [The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/access/) is the source for our data defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. 

In our study, We do consider attacks that were attempted whether they are succesful or not and classified as not doubted. This approach allow us to evaluate data from broader perspective comprehensively.


## Visualization Design

### Domain Characterization

### Data Abstraction

### Visual Encoding and Interaction Design

Example for tables:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

### Algorithm Design
